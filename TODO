*** pending disk format changes ***
- deadlists in snap tree, rather than tree blob
- hashes stored out-of-line
- remove generic header from blocks, type header
  for arenas should start with 'ge', type header
  for other blocks should be some other mnemonic
- packarena should have next gen
- small file optimizations
	- inline data
	- block fragmentation

*** major issues, need to fix ***
- live alloc log recompression
- Reserve blocks for deletion
- reclaiming data from deleted files is very delayed
- transient exec snapshots
- testing, debugging, bugfixes

*** nice to have, can go without ***
- add missing management commands in console
- performance optimization:
	- bulk block frees
	- background block frees
	- root block reuse
